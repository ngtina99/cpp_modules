# 42 C++ Modules (CPP00 — CPP09)

A consolidated workspace for my 42 School C++ modules.

## 📂 Repository Structure
  <a href="https://github.com/ngtina99/cpp09">CPP09</a> - This module taught me to apply the C++ Standard Template Library (STL), using containers, iterators, and algorithms <br>
  <a href="https://github.com/ngtina99/cpp08">CPP08</a> - The project covers templated containers, iterators, and standard algorithms <br>
  <a href="https://github.com/ngtina99/cpp07">CPP07</a> - I discovered C++ templates and applied them to various default functions <br> 
  <a href="https://github.com/ngtina99/cpp06">CPP06</a> - The project covers C++ casts, including static_cast, dynamic_cast, const_cast, and reinterpret_cast<br>
  <a href="https://github.com/ngtina99/cpp05">CPP05</a> - This module introduces exception handling and explains how to use casting and type conversions<br>
  <a href="https://github.com/ngtina99/cpp04">CPP04</a> - About subtype polymorphism, abstract classes, and interfaces to enhance code flexibility and design<br> 
  <a href="https://github.com/ngtina99/cpp03">CPP03</a> - I explored different types of inheritance, such as single, multiple, and virtual, enabling flexible code reuse<br>
  <a href="https://github.com/ngtina99/cpp02">CPP02</a> - The project involves ad-hoc polymorphism, operator overloading, canonical class form, and vector calculations<br>
  <a href="https://github.com/ngtina99/cpp01">CPP01</a> - This module taught me how to use memory allocation, pointers to members,references, switch statement<br>
  <a href="https://github.com/ngtina99/cpp00">CPP00</a> - My first exercises in C++ learning: namespaces, classes, member functions, stdio streams, initialization lists, static, const, and other basic concepts<br>
